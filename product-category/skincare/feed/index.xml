		<description><![CDATA[One Essential combats the toxins by reinvigorating the elimination process* in order to restore the skin's luminosity. A three-dimensional action:
DETOXIFIES: it continuously eliminates toxins* and frees the flow of energy at the heart of the skin.
REGENERATES and ENERGIZES: it optimizes the correct functioning of cells.
BOOSTS: it boosts by up to 4 times the effectiveness of ingredients* of your usual, subsequently applied skincare.

One Essential's fresh, air-whipped and slightly pinkish texture revives the complexion and instantly infuses it with radiance, without a pearlescent or tightening effect, nor a greasy feel.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Light and airy despite its rich powers, the Dior Prestige White Crme leaves the skin divinely smooth, even and luminous. Applied after Le Srum, it swathes the skin in velvety pleasure, infused with intense, lasting action.
The skin appears more youthful than ever, glowing with vital brightness.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This UV base envelops the skin in a tailor-made protective veil with lasting wear and proven effectiveness. The incredibly light and silky texture offers a feeling of absolute comfort. Perfectly protected for 8 hours, the skin glows with a new luminosity.<br />
The Dior expert tip: apply UV Base to the entire face. Spread the base from the center outwards and slightly upwards. This enveloping technique ensures the highest protection while smoothing the face. Complete the application by blending the texture from the chin towards the neck, and from the contours of the face towards the hairline and brow line, for a seamless finish. Apply before your makeup.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Enriched with ultra-nourishing vine wax, the creamy, melt-away texture of La Crme deeply and lastingly nourishes the driest skin and envelops it in absolute comfort.

The Dior tip: apply morning and evening to face, neck and dcollet. Glide over your face with a smoothing stroke to fully benefit from the powers of LOr de Vie. Continue down to the neck and dcollet: your hands join together under the chin, gently gliding downwards to envelop your neck and dcollet.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Applied after the Nectar de Nuit, its rich and opulent balm-like texture literally wraps the skin, deeply comforting and plumping it. It is also ideal for the delicate areas of the neck and dcollet, which regain strength and density.</p>
